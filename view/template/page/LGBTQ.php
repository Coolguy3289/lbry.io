      <h2>Companies like YouTube are afraid that advertisers will be offended by LGBTQ and sexual health content.</h2>
      <h3>We think their censorship is what's really offensive.</h3>
      <p>LBRY is a free, open source platform that makes it easy to share your videos (and charge what you want for access to them).</p>
      <p>Our system is decentralized - we care about our users, not advertisers trying to make a buck off of their hard work.</p>

      <h3>This is where you come in.</h3>
      <p>We're building LBRY for everyone, and we want you to join us! As long as it's legal, we'll never tell our users what they can and can't talk about.</p>

      <h1>Do you have a favorite LGBTQ creator?</h1>
      <p>Send them this page and ask them to sync their content today with our YouTube Partner Program.</p>
